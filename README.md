# ProcessProgramName
The program should retrieve all the program names and display them in alphabetical order.  When displaying the program names, an apostrophe ("'") should be  added to the beginning and the end of each program name.  If there are any apostrophes *within* a program name, then an additional apostrophe should be added before the existing apostrophe(s).  Use a comma (",") to separate each program name.  For example, the  string 'Test1','Test''2','Test3' is the proper output given input  values of Test1, Test'2 and Test3.
